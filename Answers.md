- [x]. What problem does the context API help solve?

    Gives you access to pass props from parent comp's to child with provider. it helps with prop drilling.

- [x] In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

    As Dad F once said - Single soruce of truth - everything comes from store. Actions are what allow you to change it via store.

- [x] What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

    component state is data help in component & application state when data is help is app. 

- [x] Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

    redux-thunk helps with API calls async functions. Middleware is used when an action is dispatched. 

- [x] What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

    I really can't say I have one - i thought i understood context api & redux but this sprint was rough. I choose to do the project today in redux because we learned context api 3 weeks ago and i wasn't recalling it well enough.
