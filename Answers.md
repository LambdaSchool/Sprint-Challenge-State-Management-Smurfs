1. What problem does the context API help solve?
    ~ Context API helps keep state clean. We would use Context API when we have global data that lots of components share.
1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
    ~ actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. 
    ~ reducers specify how the applications state changes in response to actions sent to the store. 
    ~ store brings the actions and reducers together
1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
~ applcation state is global and component state is local
1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
~ redux is my favorite. While it seems difficult to learn it seems as if there are logal steps that can be followed.
