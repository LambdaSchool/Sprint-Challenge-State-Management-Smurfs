* What problem does the context API help solve?

enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It's aimed at solving the problem of prop drilling.

*  In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

Actions send data from your application to your store, reducers tell them what they do, store holds state/passes around data

*  What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

	apps state is the global state that all components can access, Component is a Local State, Depends on size of project smaller apps would use app state 

*  Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?


*  What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

For now Context is my favorite just because I understand it more
