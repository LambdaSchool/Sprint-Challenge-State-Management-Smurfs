Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

 What problem does the context API help solve?

    ContextAPI helps you to avoid drilling props and manage state in a cleaner way. 


 In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

    Reducers tell applications to change state based on the action being performed. Actions are sent to the store which is an object that stores and handles the app's statre. Reducers return the new state. 

 What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

    Application state is global while the component state is local. With application state, something like REDUX will hold and manage state globally which means any component can access the state. Component state can only be accessed by drilling props through all of the children to the component that will update the state. 

 Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?

    Redux-Thunk is a middleware tool that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. 

 What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
    
    I think Context API makes more sense to my brain. It seems cleaner to me. I'm not sure yet if it's the best way to manage state while taking the post request into account but we'll see how it works out after I complete the sprint. HERE WE GO!
